		% \addtolength{\textheight}{-0cm}   % (Original: 12cm)This command serves to balance the column lengths
		%                                   % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
		%                                   % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
		%                                   % This command does not take effect until the next page
		%                                   % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
		%                                   % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
